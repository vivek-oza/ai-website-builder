# AI Website Builder

I’m building a simple way to go from idea to website. It’s early and a bit rough.

A tiny idea with big ambitions. 
This project aims to make spinning up beautiful, functional websites feel more like a conversation than a chore.

Type what you want, and watch a site take shape (psst: this is nothing like ordinary AI website builders—I'm doing it differently).

## Status
Early peek. Some parts sparkle; others are cardboard cutouts. Things will change.
(I mean I'm still building it.)

## Near-term
- Calmer UI
- Smoother idea → page

## Contributions
Not open yet. I’ll share guidelines when the core is ready.

## Follow along
Star the repo and check back soon.
